features:
  - |
    Added new setting ``OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_ENDPOINT_TYPE`` that can be used to
    specify the endpoint type to use when talking to the identity API. The default
    is set to the value of ``OPENSTACK_ENDPOINT_TYPE`` for backward compatibility.
upgrade:
  - |
    If you are setting ``OPENSTACK_ENDPOINT_TYPE`` to change the default endpoint type
    for Keystone you must now set ``OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_ENDPOINT_TYPE`` as the former
    now only applies to other services.
