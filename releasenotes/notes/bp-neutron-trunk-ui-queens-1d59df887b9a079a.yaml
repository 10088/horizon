    [`blueprint neutron-trunk-ui <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/neutron-trunk-ui>`_]
    Partial support for Neutron Trunks. The Project/Network/Trunks
    panel turns on if Neutron API extension 'trunk' is available. It
    displays information about trunks. The details page for each trunk
    also shows information about subports of that trunk.
    Supported actions: create, delete.
