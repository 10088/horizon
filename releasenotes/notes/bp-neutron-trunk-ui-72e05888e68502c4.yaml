    [`blueprint neutron-trunk-ui <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/neutron-trunk-ui>`_]
    Add partial support for Neutron Trunks. Since the panel is
    incomplete in Pike, it is disabled by default. An example 'enabled'
    file is supplied.  After enabling it the Project/Network/Trunks
    panel turns on if Neutron API extension 'trunk' is available. It
    displays information about trunks. The details page for each trunk
    also shows information about subports of that trunk.
    Currently supported actions: delete.
