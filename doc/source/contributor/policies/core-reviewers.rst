==================
Core Reviewer Team
==================

The Horizon Core Reviewer Team is responsible for many aspects of the
Horizon project. These include, but are not limited to:

- Mentor community contributors in solution design, testing, and the
  review process
- Actively reviewing patch submissions, considering whether the patch:
  - is functional
  - fits the use-cases and vision of the project
  - is complete in terms of testing, documentation, and release notes
  - takes into consideration upgrade concerns from previous versions
- Assist in bug triage and delivery of bug fixes
- Curating the gate and triaging failures
- Maintaining accurate, complete, and relevant documentation
- Ensuring the level of testing is adequate and remains relevant as
  features are added
- Answering questions and participating in mailing list discussions
- Interfacing with other OpenStack teams

In essence, core reviewers share the following common ideals:

- They share responsibility in the project's success in its mission.
- They value a healthy, vibrant, and active developer and user community.
- They have made a long-term, recurring time investment to improve the project.
- They spend their time doing what needs to be done to ensure the
  project's success, not necessarily what is the most interesting or
  fun.
- A core reviewer's responsibility doesn't end with merging code.

Core Reviewer Expectations
--------------------------

Members of the core reviewer team are expected to:

- Attend and participate in the weekly IRC meetings (if your timezone allows)
- Monitor and participate in-channel at #openstack-horizon
- Monitor and participate in [Horizon] discussions on the mailing list
- Participate in related design summit sessions at the OpenStack
  Summits and Project Team Gatherings
- Review patch submissions actively and consistently

Please note in-person attendance at design summits, mid-cycles, and
other code sprints is not a requirement to be a core reviewer.
Participation can also include contributing to the design documents
discussed at the design sessions.

Active and consistent review of review activity, bug triage and other
activity will be performed monthly and fed back to the Core Reviewer Team
so everyone knows how things are progressing.

Code Merge Responsibilities
---------------------------

While everyone is encouraged to review changes, members of the core
reviewer team have the ability to +2/-2 and +A changes to these
repositories. This is an extra level of responsibility not to be taken
lightly. Correctly merging code requires not only understanding the
code itself, but also how the code affects things like documentation,
testing, upgrade impacts and interactions with other projects. It also
means you pay attention to release milestones and understand if a
patch you are merging is marked for the release, especially critical
during the feature freeze.
